## Creating neighborhood matrices for Spatial Polygons in R

```{r}
setwd("~/Downloads/vg250_0101.utm32s.shape.ebenen")
shape = rgdal::readOGR(dsn="vg250_ebenen",layer="VG250_VWG")
```

### Contiguity based relations - First Order Queen Contiguity

are the most used in the presence of irregular polygons with varying shape and surface, since contiguity ignores distance and focuses instead on the location of an area. The function poly2nb allows to create 2 types of contiguity based relations:

FOQ contiguity defines a neighbor when at least one point on the boundary of one polygon is shared with at least one point of its neighbor (common border or corner);


```{r}
neighb = spdep::poly2nb(shape, queen=TRUE)
#row.names refers to the unique names of each polygon

neighb2 <- lapply(neighb, function(x)if(x[1]==0){return(NULL)}else{return(x)})
N<-length(neighb2)
n.nr <- unlist(lapply(neighb2,length))
neighb2 <- unlist(neighb2)
i = c(1:N, rep(1:N, n.nr))
j = c(1:N, neighb2)
x = c(n.nr, rep(-1, sum(n.nr)))
matrix<-sparseMatrix(i=i,j=j,x=x)
```


Calling nb.FOQ you get a summary of the neighbor matrix, including the total number of areas/counties, and average number of links.
2. First Order Rook Contiguity

FOR contiguity does not include corners, only borders, thus comprising only polygons sharing more than one boundary point;

nb.RK = poly2nb(NC, queen=FALSE, row.names=NC$FIPSNO)

## Neighbour list object:
## Number of regions: 100
## Number of nonzero links: 462
## Percentage nonzero weights: 4.62
## Average number of links: 4.62

NB: if there is a region without any link, there will be a message like this:
Neighbour list object:
Number of regions: 910
Number of nonzero links: 4620
Percentage nonzero weights: 0.5924405
Average number of links: 5.391209
10 regions with no links:
1014 3507 3801 8245 9018 10037 22125 30005 390299 390399

where you can identify the regions with no links (1014, 3507,…) using which(…), and in R it is possible to “manually” connect them or change the neighbor matrix so that they can be included (such as graph or distance based neighbors).
Sometimes, it also happens that some polygons that have been retouched (sounds like a blasphemy but it happens a lot with historical maps) may not recognize shared borders. This is when manually setting up neighbors comes in handy (you can’t do that in Geoda).

Contiguity

Higher order neighbors are useful when looking at the effect of lags on spatial autocorrelation and in spatial autoregressive models like SAR with a more global spatial autocorrelation:

nb.SRC = nblag(nb.RK,2) #second order rook contiguity

B. Distance based neighbors

DBN defines a set of connections between polygons either based on a (1) defined Euclidean distance between centroids dnearneigh or a certain (2) number of neighbors knn2nb (e.g. 5 nearest neighbors);

coordNC = coordinates(NC) #get centroids coordinates
d05m = dnearneigh(coordNC, 0, 0.5, row.names=NC$FIPSNO)
nb.5NN = knn2nb(knearneigh(coordNC,k=5),row.names=NC$FIPSNO) #set the number of neighbors (here 5)

a little trick: if you want information on neighbor distances whatever the type of neighborhood may be:

distance = unlist(nbdists(nb.5NN, coordNC))

C. Graph based (I’ve never used them, but it’s good to know that they exist)

Delauney triangulation tri2nb constructs neighbors through Voronoi triangles such that each centroid is a triangle node. As a consequence, DT ensures that every polygon has a neighbor, even in presence of islands. The “problem” with this specification is that it treats our area of study as if it were an island itself, without any neighbors (as if North Carolina were an island with no Virginia or South Carolina)… Therefore, distant points that would not be neighbors (such as Cherokee and Brunswick counties) become such;
Gabriel Graph gabrielneigh is a particular case of the DT, where a and b are two neighboring points/centroids if in the circles passing by a and b with diameter ab does not lie any other point/centroid;
Sphere of Influence soi.graph: twopoints a and b are SOI neighbors if the circles centered on a and b, of radius equal to the a and b nearest neighbour distances, intersect twice. It is a sort of Delauney triangulation without the longest connections;
Relative Neighbors relativeneigh is a particular case of GG. A border belongs to RN if the intersection formed by the two circles centered in a and b with radius ab does not contain any other point.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
